# Helios

Helios is an innovative operating system that integrates local AI models with built-in powertools for Solana blockchain development and Pump Fun deployment capabilities. Currently under active development.

## Overview

Helios aims to create a seamless development environment where AI capabilities are built directly into the operating system layer, enabling powerful local AI processing while maintaining user privacy and control. The system includes specialized tools for blockchain development, particularly focused on the Solana ecosystem.

## Features

### Local AI Integration
- Built-in support for local AI model execution
- Privacy-focused architecture keeping AI processing on-device
- Integrated AI assistants for development workflows

### Blockchain Development Tools
- Native Solana development environment
- Built-in powertools for smart contract development
- Streamlined deployment process to Pump Fun
- Integrated blockchain debugging tools

### System Architecture
- Custom kernel written in Rust
- Optimized for AI workload processing
- Secure by design with blockchain integration
- Modern async/await support

## Current Status

This project is currently under development in a private repository. The core features are being actively developed and tested. Public releases will be announced when ready.

## Building from Source
